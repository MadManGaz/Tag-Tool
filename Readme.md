# Tag Tool

This is a no thrills, badly written tag tool thing that has the purpose of automating some mind numbing clerical tasks for work. Really only meant for myself, so it's bad, but it works for me.

Pretty sure there are things that shouldn't be in the view controllers and things that shouldn't be in the models, if any lost soul finds this, i'd appreaciate advice :p.
